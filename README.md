MyVids
======================

A simple video gallery system for MyBB with many features.

This is the initial, free beta of MyVids. This is the first ever public release and the first time MyVids has been out of my test area. I fully advise a trial run in a localhost so you know how things work before going live with this plugin - there is a LOT to go wrong.

Instalation
----------------------
1 Upload all the files in the _Upload_ folder to your MyBB forum root directory.
2 Make the changes found in the _htacess.txt_ file to your _.htaccess_ file if you wish to enable _SEO URLs_ for videos.
3 Install and activate the plugin via the ACP as usual.
4 Edit the MyVids settings to suit your needs and set up the usergroup settings (NOTE: GUEST UPLAODING DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK - MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO COMMENT OR ADD VIDEOS!!!)
5 Enjoy!


Support
----------------------
As this is a beta, __there is not support available__. Once the gold version is released however, support will be available for this mod.

Please note that although this is a beta, there could be frequent updates to the free version as new bugs and issues emerge. I'll also be optimising the code from this very first release over time so the plugin is actually acceptable.
