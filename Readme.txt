This is the initial, free beta of MyVids. This is the first ever public release and the first time MyVids has been out of my test area. I fully advise a trial run in a localhost so you know how things work before going live with this plugin - there is a LOT to go wrong.

== INSTALLATION ==

[*] Upload all the files in the "upload" folder to your MyBB forums' root directory.

[*] Make the changes found in the htacess.txt file to your .htaccess file if you wish to enable "SEO URLs" for videos.

[*] Install and activate the plugin via the ACP as usual.

[*] Edit the MyVids settings to suit your needs and set up the usergroup settings (NOTE: GUEST UPLAODING DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK - MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO COMMENT OR ADD VIDEOS!!!)

[*] Enjoy!


== SUPPORT ==

As this is a beta, there is full support available. You can receive support from either community.mybb.com or mybbsource.com (where you are more likely to receive a fast response from our team). Once the gold version is released exclusively at MyBBSource however, support will be less frequent for this mod.

Please note that although this is a beta, there could be frequent updates to the free version (read: this package) as new bugs and issues emerge. I'll also be optimising the code from this very first release over time so the plugin is actually acceptable (well, it is now really, but plenty more can be done).
